# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python which will be used to clean, prepare, and explore the data, as well as to complete further analysis.

## Database Storage
Postgres with pgAdmin is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate a connection from our Jupyter notebook to display the data. 

## Machine Learning
SKlearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup will be looking at the Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks approach to build a machine learning model. This will help us with our overall goal of classifying social media posts into the correct Myer Briggs personality type.

## Dashboard
We will be creating a Tableau Public dashboard for a fully functioning and interactive platform to showcase our data and results. It will be hosted on the Tableau Public platform and made visible to all so that the dashboard is easily accessible.
